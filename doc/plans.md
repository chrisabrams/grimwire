### Plans for Grimwire.com

<strong class="label">Grimwire</strong> and its libraries (Local, LinkJS, MyHouse, CommonClient) are MIT-licensed open-source software. <a href="https://github.com/pfraze" target="_top">They are available on GitHub</a> and may be distributed in any form.

<strong class="label">Grimwire.com</strong> is a service for collaborative software development and social computing. Its primary task is to develop and support the Grimwire environment, so that users can easily run their own deployments at home (or in the cloud).

<strong class="label">Grimwire</strong> is hosted on NodeJS, and I'm currently evaluating <a href="http://datomic.com" target="_top">Datomic</a> as the core storage. More details on its application structure will be released as the software solidifies.
