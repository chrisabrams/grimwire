<strong class="label"><a href="http://grimwire.com/local" target="_top" title="Local">Local</a></strong> was created to structure Web Workers into a configurable environment. It uses HTTPL to communicate with the programs, and enforces security through a central messaging router. Common client behaviors remove the need for Workers to touch the document, instead allowing them to control the UI with markup directives. These tools can be hosted statically at any website to host user applications.

<strong class="label">Grimwire</strong> is a general-purpose deployment of Local. Its target is to be an easily-moddable, easily-deployable web desktop environment. The features are still in development, and will be added gradually over time while security and ease-of-use are evaluated. Currently implemented or planned:

 - User data management, permissioning, and publishing
 - App capabilities control for executing untrusted software
 - In-browser development tools with services for storing and serving scripts
 - A well-documented API for modding and extending the UI
 - A powerful, composable interface built around Local's messaging system
