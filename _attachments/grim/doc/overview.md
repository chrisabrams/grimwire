<strong class="label">I created</strong> <a href="httpl://grimwire.com/local" target="_top" title="Local">Local</a> to structure Web Workers into a configurable environment. It uses HTTPL to communicate with the programs, and enforces security through a central messaging router. Common client behaviors remove the need for Workers to touch the document, instead allowing them to control the UI with markup directives. These tools can be hosted statically at any website to host user applications.

<strong class="label">Grimwire</strong> is a general-purpose deployment of Local. It is built with a strong focus toward collaborative computing, and as a staging ground for UI experiments.
