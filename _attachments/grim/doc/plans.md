### Plans for Grimwire.com

<strong class="label">Grimwire</strong> and its libraries (Local, LinkJS, MyHouse, CommonClient) are MIT-licensed open-source software. <a href="https://github.com/pfraze" target="_top">They are available on GitHub</a> and may be distributed in any form.

<strong class="label">Grimwire.com</strong> is a service for collaborative software development and social computing. Its primary task is to develop and support the Grimwire environment, so that users can easily run their own deployments at home (<a href="http://www.iriscouch.com/" target="_top">or in the cloud</a>).

<strong class="label">Grimwire</strong> is hosted on CouchDB, which shares the FOSS philosophy. It offers a NoSQL Web-service, deployable CouchApps, and easy replication, which should make Grimwire instances simple to deploy and administer.
