### An Introduction

<strong>Hello!</strong> and welcome to the grimwire environment. With this document, you have the power to invoke javascript from anywhere across the globe, safely, and compatibly. Using an arcane element known as the Web Worker, Grimwire cages user software and forces it to behave as a RESTful Web Server. This means you can run multiple web applications in your browser together; in fact, you're doing it right now!

<strong>On your left</strong> are your Intents. Drag them onto interfaces to see what they do. (They'll always confirm an action.) You can drag them onto forms within interfaces to get different effects.

Links and buttons can be dragged too!

<strong>On the top</strong> are the active scripts -- one for every worker. Try opening the Debug Index, then dragging the Load intent onto one of the program descriptions.

You can find out about how this all works by [reading the technical docs](http://grimwire.com/local/). Feel free to click around, but keep in mind that this is just a technology preview. An open release should be coming soon!
