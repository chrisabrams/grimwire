### An Introduction

<strong class="label">Hello!</strong> and welcome to Grimwire, an operating system in the browser. Using an arcane element known as the Web Worker, Grimwire runs user javascripts as if they were remote Web servers. This means you can run multiple web applications in your browser together &ndash; in fact, you're doing it right now!

<strong class="label">On your left</strong> are your Intents. Drag them onto interfaces to see what they do. (They'll always confirm an irreversable action.) <small class="muted">Links can be dragged too!</small>

<strong class="label">On the top right</strong> are the active programs. <small class="muted">There's one for every Web Worker running.</small> See the apps I'm sharing, in the middle column? <small class="muted">mail/list.js, forum/ffs.js</small> Try dragging the "Load" intent onto one of their descriptions.<small class="muted">The Load intent is the power-icon on the left.</small>

<strong class="label">You can find out</strong> about how this all works by <a href="http://grimwire.com/local/" target="_top">reading the API documentation</a>. Feel free to click around, but keep in mind that this is just a developer preview. The beta release will be announced when it's ready.
