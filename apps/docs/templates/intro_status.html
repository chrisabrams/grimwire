		<p>Grimwire is just now reaching its first release, <span class="label">0.1.0</span>, which is a developer preview. Many of the techniques it's using are new and still being refined. You should expect some amount of API stability as we understand our use-cases better.</p>

		<p>The roadmap for <span class="label">0.1.x</span> is focused on application toolset and usability. This will include work on UI control, credential and user-data management, deployment, and efficiency in core. During this period, Grimwire will not be capable of executing untrusted software, and will be most useful for its architecture, user-modifiability, and privacy tools.</p>

		<p><span class="label">0.2.x</span> will focus on executing untrusted software, enabling software-sharing (app stores, social) and P2P. Its roadmap will include permissions policies, extensive security reviews, and WebRTC integration.</p>

		<p><span class="label">0.3.x</span> and later will focus on new computing interfaces, including mobile, the Oculus Rift, Google Glass, the Leap Motion, and any other new I/O developments. Some of these features may be introduced earlier in the timeline, depending on some necessary browser technologies.</p>

<h3>How to Deal with Alpha-Version Shortcomings</h3>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span8">
		<p>Not having direct access to the document will be frustrating at first. There are some tasks which you'll find effortless, some other tasks which will require digging through the docs, and yet other tasks which you'll find aren't possible yet. We understand how off-putting that can be! Learning a new platform is a commitment of time and energy, and we always want it to pay off.</p>

		<p><strong>At this time, you're most likely to find road-blocks when you need fine-grained control over the UI</strong>. For instance, if you need an individual component that isn't provided by HTML or Twitter Bootstrap, you may have trouble implementing it with a request/response flow. There are some times when you just need to hook into DOM events and start mutating element state, and grim apps aren't given that power.</p>

		<p><strong>The solution to this is to add new widgets to your deployment of Grimwire.</strong> The process for this is explained in <a href="httpl://{{domain}}/concepts/page-env" type="application/html-deltas+json" target="docs-layout" title="Page Environment">Page Environment</a>. Any widgets you add to your host are unlikely to be found in other deployments, so using them will reduce compatability. However, Grimwire's maturation process (particularly during 0.1.x) includes building a broad enough suite of widgets to meet all use cases; if you think your addition would help us accomplish that, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/grimwire" target="_blank" title="Grimwire Groogle Group">let us know in the Group Group</a> and we'll look into merging into core.</p>

		<blockquote class="muted">The best tools cover the most use-cases with the least overhead. If you find new solutions to getting fine-grained control over the UI, let us know!</blockquote>

		<p>If you find yourself at a dead end that's not UI related, then you might have found a problem we haven't anticipated. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/grimwire" target="_blank" title="Grimwire Groogle Group">Be sure to let us know about it</a> so that we can find a solution for you!</p>

<h3>Should I Use Grimwire Yet?</h3>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span8">
		<p>This is a good question to ask. The viability of Grimwire is entirely dependent on support. If your users are likely to use old versions of Internet Explorer or are mobile-bound, Grimwire may not be the right choice. (<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=web%20workers" target="_blank" title="CanIUse.com: WebWorkers">At this time, Web Workers are the blocking dependency.</a>) However, if you can weather some alpha-stage quirks (and diss the users with outdated browsers) we think Grimwire will be a strong investment that will increase in value as its community and platform is developed.</p>
