	<p>Grimwire is just now reaching its first release, <span class="label">0.1.0</span>, which is a developer preview. Many of the techniques it's using are new and still being refined. You should expect some amount of API stability as we understand our use-cases better.</p>

	<p>The roadmap for <span class="label">0.1.x</span> is focused on application toolset and usability. This will include work on UI control, credential and user-data management, deployment, and efficiency in core. During this period, Grimwire will not be capable of executing untrusted software.</p>

	<p><span class="label">0.2.x</span> will focus on executing untrusted software, enabling software-sharing (app stores, social) and P2P. Its roadmap will include permissions policies, security reviews, and WebRTC integration.</p>

	<p><span class="label">0.3.x</span> and later will focus on new computing interfaces, including mobile, the Oculus Rift, Google Glass, the Leap Motion, and any other new I/O developments. Some of these features may be introduced earlier in the timeline, depending on some necessary browser technologies.</p>

	<h4>Browser Support</h4>

	<p>At this time, Chrome 26, Firefox 21, Opera 12.12, and Safari 5.1.7 (Windows &amp; iOS) have been tested and appear to work correctly. Internet Explorer is not yet supported.</p>

	<p><strong>Content Security Policies.</strong> CSP are an important part of Grimwire's security model. However, Safari 5 does not correctly support them (breaking the page) and Firefox does not yet allow the directive through the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag (currently filed as a bug). As a result, in Grimwire's default settings, only recent versions of Chrome are protected from client-side code injection. If untrusted code or content will be run on your site, make sure CSPs are in use!</p>

	<h4>Dealing with Alpha-Version Shortcomings</h4>

	<p>Not having direct access to the document will be frustrating at first. There are some tasks which you'll find effortless, some other tasks which will require digging through the docs, and yet other tasks which you'll find aren't possible yet. We understand how off-putting that can be! Learning a new platform is a commitment of time and energy, and we always want it to pay off.</p>

	<p><strong>At this time, you're most likely to find road-blocks when you need fine-grained control over the UI</strong>. For instance, if you need an individual component that isn't provided by HTML or Twitter Bootstrap, you may have trouble implementing it with a request/response flow. The solution to this is to add new widgets to your deployment of Grimwire (explained in <a href="httpl://{{domain}}/concepts/page-env" type="application/html-deltas+json" target="docs-layout" title="Page Environment">Page Environment</a>). Any widgets you add to your host are unlikely to be found in other deployments, so using them will reduce compatability. However, Grimwire's development (particularly during 0.1.x) includes building a broad enough suite of widgets to meet all use cases; if you think your addition would help us accomplish that, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/grimwire" target="_blank" title="Grimwire Groogle Group">let us know in the Group Group</a> and we'll look into merging into core.</p>

	<p>If you find yourself at a dead end that's not UI related, then you might have found a problem we haven't anticipated. <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/grimwire" target="_blank" title="Grimwire Groogle Group">Be sure to let us know about it</a> so that we can find a solution for you!</p>
