  <p><strong>Every application is isolated from the document using Web Workers.</strong> This allows Grimwire to make decisions for its programs: how their responses should be interpreted, how they compose, how they share resources, and how they're kept secure.</p>
  <p><strong>Multi-threading comes by default.</strong> Applications can easily add more workers, and additional transports for messaging &ndash; including WebSockets and WebRTC &ndash; can integrate in future releases without changes to the userland.</p>
  <p><strong>Server-side-only doesn't mean dumb UIs.</strong> Grimwire provides a toolset for building rich real-time UIs without violating REST principles. As a result, most tools available to local servers are available to remote servers as well &ndash; the only difference is latency!</p>
