	<p><strong>The Web is constantly on the move, even if your users browsers aren't.</strong> Often, developers have to ignore new APIs due to issues with backward compatibility. Half of the development schedule is spent on building; the other half is spent checking IE8.</p>
	<p><strong>Compatability will never be free, but it can certainly be cheaper.</strong> Since Grim is built on Web Workers, it can't help you with your IE problems &ndash; but it can help you in the future. New technologies like WebSockets, WebRTC, user motion-trackers, and head-mounted displays will integrate directly into Grimwire without changing how you write software.</p>
	<p><strong>Grimwire acts as an intermediary between your app and the page.</strong> By constraining applications into the server-side, Grimwire can interpret requests and responses according to the features of the environment. This means hosts can apply themes, features can cleanly degrade, and interfaces can operate in any context.</p>
	<p><strong>Server-side-only doesn't mean dumb UIs.</strong> Grimwire provides a toolset for building rich real-time UIs without violating REST principles. As a result, most tools available to local servers are available to remote servers as well &ndash; the only difference is latency!</p>
