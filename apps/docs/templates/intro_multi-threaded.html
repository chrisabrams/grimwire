	<p><strong>Simple comes before easy &ndash; but you still want both.</strong> While most Javascript frameworks are moving to frontend development, Grimwire is purely server-side. This constraint allows Grimwire to make decisions for its programs: how their responses should be interpreted, how they compose, how they share resources, and how they're kept secure.</p>
	<p><strong>Server-side-only doesn't mean dumb UIs.</strong> Grimwire provides a toolset for building rich real-time UIs without violating REST principles. As a result, most tools available to local servers are available to remote servers as well &ndash; the only difference is latency!</p>
