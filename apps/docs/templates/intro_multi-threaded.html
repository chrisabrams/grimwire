	<p><strong>Simple comes before easy &ndash; but you still want both.</strong> While most Javascript frameworks are moving to frontend development, Grimwire is purely server-side. This constraint allows Grimwire to make decisions for its programs: how their responses should be interpreted, how they compose, how they share resources, and how they're kept secure.</p>
	<p><strong>A strong design gets the most value out of the least effort.</strong> Grimwire's stateless server programs are easy to maintain and deliver increasing value in an ecosystem of integrated pieces. The measure of a good app in Grimwire is how well it can bend.</p>
	<p><strong>Server-side-only doesn't mean dumb UIs.</strong> Grimwire provides a toolset for building rich real-time UIs without violating REST principles. As a result, most tools available to local servers are available to remote servers as well &ndash; the only difference is latency!</p>
	<p><strong>As Grimwire evolves, your applications will as well.</strong> New technologies like WebRTC, gesture recognition, and head-mounted displays will fundamentally change how we interact with computers. Grimwire is dedicated to pushing those technologies forward and fostering an ecosystem of FOSS around them.</p>
