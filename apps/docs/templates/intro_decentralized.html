	<p><strong>The Web is how we come together,</strong> and the ways we interact affect the values we hold as a community. While we find new ways to connect, we should continue to value our traditions of independence, transparency, and respect. Users should never be a product.</p>
	<p><strong>Grimwire is designed for P2P multi-user computing.</strong> Using WebRTC to transport requests between browsers, users will serve applications directly to each other without operating a dedicated host&ndash; and, due to RESTful design, without modifying their programs to add support.</p>
	<p><em>WebRTC integration, and the necessary permissions and security policies to support it, are still on their way. Until then, applications must be delivered by hosted services, and untrusted programs should not be executed.</em></p>
