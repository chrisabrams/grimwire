  <p><strong>Grimwire has no backend dependencies.</strong> It is fully client-side, and can be hosted statically by Apache, Nginx, and any other Web server. Services can theme and deploy it for their users, and individuals can host their own instance &ndash; or use the <a href="http://grimwire.github.io/grimwire/" target="_blank" title="Grimwire Nightly Build">nightly build on GitHub pages</a>.</p>
	<p><strong>Everything is built for P2P multi-user computing.</strong> Once WebRTC and the necessary permissions tools are ready, Grimwire will transport requests between browsers, allowing users to serve applications directly to each other without operating a dedicated host.</p>
