	<p><strong>The Web should not be a black box.</strong> For security reasons, applications have been delivered uniformly by remote hosts in a one-size-fits-all approach. Not only does this stifle innovation, but it raises serious privacy concerns as users are forced to use remote backends for their data. That's a real problem!</p>
	<p><strong>FOSS means that users control their software.</strong> When users get the freedom to change their software, they gain the power to meet their own needs. By using Grimwire, you provide an application platform which your users can cultivate and improve, allowing your service to gain value while you focus on your core offering.</p>
	<p><strong>Privacy is the default, not the exception.</strong> Simple tools for configuration and storage make it easy to respect sensitive data. If there's ever a problem, users can open up the "Applications" interface, clone the program, and alter it to use an endpoint they control.</p>
	<p><strong>The Internet is horizontal, not top-down.</strong> With moddability in the hands of everyone, the Web is open to flourish and evolve. Nobody should be satisfied with a few networks that were lucky enough to reach saturation. The Web belongs to everybody; it's applications should too.</p>
