	<p><strong>The Web should not be a black box.</strong> For security reasons, applications have been delivered uniformly by remote hosts in a one-size-fits-all approach. Not only does this stifle innovation, but it raises serious privacy concerns as users are forced to use remote backends for their data. That's a real problem!</p>
	<p><strong>FOSS means that users control their software.</strong> When users get the freedom to change their software, they gain the power to meet their own needs. By using Grimwire, you provide a platform which your users can improve.</p>
	<p><strong>Privacy is the default, not the exception.</strong> Simple tools for configuration and storage make it easy to respect sensitive data. If there's ever a problem, users can open up the "Applications" interface, clone the program, and alter it to use an endpoint they control.</p>
