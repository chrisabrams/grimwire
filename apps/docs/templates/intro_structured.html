	<p><strong>What is it about the Unix architecture that's made it so strong?</strong> The answer is simple: philosophy. Not just any philosophy, but a universal vision for compact, composable programs in a unified system of files and streams.</p>
	<p><strong>Grimwire shares the Unix values, adapted for the Web.</strong> It believes that by using REST as the universal interface to software (both local and remote) it can enable compact, stateless programs to compose with the same power of Unix, and with all the advantages of the Web.</p>
	<p><strong>By layering the REST protocol over Web Workers messaging API,</strong> Grimwire enables fully-isolated, on-demand Web servers to run in the browser. This forms a private namespace (under the "httpl" protocol) which can be targeted by links, forms, and Ajax calls. It calls this "HTTP Local."</p>
	<p><strong>Grimwire adds a program architecture to the client.</strong> With Hypermedia tools (such as the programmatic link navigator) and recent HTML5 APIs (such as Server-Sent Events) users can write software that's discoverable, extensible, loosely-coupled, and easy to syncronize.</p>
