	<p><strong>Grimwire shares the Unix philosophy, adapted for the Web.</strong> It believes that by using a universal interface to software (both local and remote) it can enable compact programs to compose with the same power of Unix, and with all the advantages of the Web.</p>
	<p><strong>By layering the REST protocol over Web Workers messaging API,</strong> Grimwire enables fully-isolated, on-demand Web servers to run in the browser. This forms a private namespace (under the "httpl" protocol) which can be targeted by links, forms, and Ajax calls. It calls this "HTTP Local."</p>
	<p><strong>Grimwire adds a program architecture to the client.</strong> With Hypermedia tools (such as the programmatic link navigator) and recent HTML5 APIs (such as Server-Sent Events) users can write software that's discoverable, extensible, and easy to syncronize.</p>
